# Network-System-on-a-Small-Residential-Area
In this project we are implementing a small residential area network system. LAN  covers a relatively small geographic area with a high speed data network. It will  connect personal computers, IP-Phones, Servers and other devices. 
Our network will 
offer many advantages, including shared access to devices and applications, file 
exchanges between connected users, and communication via electronic mail and 
other applications.
This project is designed as a residential area with five 5-storey buildings. Each 
building has 10 apartments two per floor having a PC, TV, IP phone. There is a 
basement which contains a security checkup room, garage room each having a PC 
and IP Phone, and manager room having a PC, IP Phone and TV. There is a meeting 
room on the room floor with TV, IP Phone and Wi-Fi facility. The rooftop is an 
indoor playground having a TV set, IP phone and Wi-Fi facility. There will be a 
server room in the 3
rd building of the area contains a PC, IP Phone, TV and a Server.
